## This folder contains train & test code for other models such as LSTM, RNN, PatchRNN, SPI-CM, and E-SPI.

### If training is required, please follow the steps:
1. Download the vector embedding in this folder from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leadbest/googlenewsvectorsnegative300
2. Run the Jupyter notebook for each model to train and test the model (e.g run LSTM.ipynb for training LSTM and save the weights)

### If testing is required using model weights, please follow the steps:
1. Use test.py to run the models by specifying the test data csv file and model weights path.
