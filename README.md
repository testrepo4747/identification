# Security Issues Identification using Commit Messages

This repository contains code for training and testing various language models to identify security issues in commit messages from open-source software (OSS) repositories. The models included are BERT, CodeBERT, GAN-BERT, and other approaches such as LSTM, RNN, PatchRNN, SPI-CM, and E-SPI.

## Directory Structure

- **bert**: Contains code for training and testing the BERT model.
- **code-bert**: Contains code for training and testing CodeBERT for generating commit messages from code changes.
- **gan-bert**: Contains code for training and testing GAN-BERT to identify security issues using labeled and unlabeled data.
- **other_models**: Contains code for training and testing models such as LSTM, RNN, PatchRNN, SPI-CM, and E-SPI.
